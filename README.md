### DESCRIPTION
Is this not the cutest little display for the Raspberry Pi? It features a 2.4" display with 320x240 16-bit color pixels and a resistive touch overlay. The HAT uses the high speed SPI interface on the Pi and can use the mini display as a console, X window port, displaying images or video etc. Best of all it plugs right in on top!

It's designed to fit nicely onto the Pi Model Zero, A+, B+, Pi 2, Pi 3 - any Pi with a 2x20 connector.

This design uses the hardware SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0, CE1) as well as GPIO #25 and #24. All other GPIO are unused. Since we had a tiny bit of space, there's 5 spots for optional slim tactile switches wired to five GPIOs, that you can use if you want to make a basic user interface. For example, you can use one as a power on/off button.

We have a right-angle 26-pin connector off to the side. You can connect a classic 26-pin Raspberry Pi GPIO cable in order to access the rest of the GPIO through a Cobbler, etc.

To make it super easy for use: we've created a custom kernel package based of off Notro's awesome framebuffer work, so you can install it over your existing Raspbian (or derivative) images in just a few commands.

Each order ships with an assembled HAT with 2.4" TFT display with resistive touchscreen and a 2x20 female socket header. Some light soldering is required to attach the header but it is easy work for anyone with a soldering iron & solder.Alternatively, you can use a stacking type header instead if you'd like to plug a 2x20 GPIO cable on top

Raspberry Pi, Pi enclosure, 26-pin GPIO cable, tactile switches are not included!
